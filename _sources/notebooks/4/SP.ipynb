The farmer would take optimal solutions as given in perfect information chapter repectively. The mean profit in the long run will be the mean of the three figures, namely \\$115,406 per year.\n",

    "Now assume again the yields vary over years but on a random basis. The farmer does not get prior information on the yields. So, the best he can do in the long run is to take the solution as given in the two-stage stochastic program. The difference between this figure and the value in the case of perfect information is $the$ $expected$ $value$ $of$ $perfect$ $information$ (EVPI). It represents the loss of profit due to the presence of uncertainty. \n",
