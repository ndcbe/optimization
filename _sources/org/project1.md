# Project 1

Summary: With a partner, you will explore an optimization model/case study using Pyomo.

## Learning Goals

By completing this project, you will:
* Practice formulating and analyzing optimization problems on paper
* Develop proficiency in Python and Pyomo
* Analyze and discuss optimization results
* Make publication quality figures

## Choosing a Problem

Select an optimization problem of interest to your team. Recommendation: choose a *simple* optimization problem from literature or a textbook. You want to choose an optimization problem where all of the input data/parameters are available and a model has already been formulated. Recommended resources to find examples:
* [Hands-On Mathematical Optimization with Python](https://mobook.github.io/MO-book/intro.html)
* [ND Pyomo Cookbook](https://jckantor.github.io/ND-Pyomo-Cookbook/README.html)
* [Pyomo â€” Optimization Modeling in Python](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-68928-5)
* [Applications of Optimization with Xpress-MP](https://examples.xpress.fico.com/example.pl#mosel_app)
* [Introduction to Stochastic Programming](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4614-0237-4)

Your project must enhance or extend the source reference material. For example, if you reproduced an optimization example from a textbook, you should perform a small additional analysis to gain a new insight about the problem not already discussed in the reference. If you choose an example that already has a Pyomo implementation, you need to extend the model in some way; this ensures that everyone gets some Pyomo practice in the project.

## Deliverable: Jupyter Notebook

Prepare a Jupyter notebook similar to our class examples. Your notebook should include:
* Problem definition
* Description (and possible visualization) of the data sources
* Optimization model typeset and explained
* If appropriate, a diagram to explain the problem description or optimization problem
* Degree of freedom analysis for the optimization problem
* Optimization model implemented and solved in Pyomo
* Analysis including at least one visualization of the optimization solution(s)
* A short paragraph explaining how your paragraph goes beyond the reference material
* A list of references, including all sources for data, models, figures, codes, etc.

You and your partner will contribute these notebooks to the class website.

## Deliverable: Class Presentation

You and your partner will give a 5-minute presentation to the class. Your presentation should:
* Clearly state the problem and summarize the input data
* Provide an overview of the optimization formulation. What type of optimization problem is it? How many variables and constraints?
* Present and analyze the optimization results
* Draw at least one conclusion from the optimization results
* Your slides should be professionally formatted including:
  * Slide numbers
  * References for all sources for data, figures, models, codes, etc. you did not create
  * Publication quality figures
  * Font large enough to see from the back of our classroom on the projector
