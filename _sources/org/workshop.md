# Computational Optimization in Python (São Paulo, Brazil)

Welcome! This website is the main page for our shortcourse, *PRO5996 - Otimização Computacional em Python*.

## Learning Objectives
1. Explore optimization modeling paradigms including (non)linear programming, mixed integer programming, disjunctive programming, dynamic optimization, and stochastic programming
2. Implement and solver computational optimization problems in the Pyomo ecosystem
3. Explore data science methods including nonlinear regression and model-based design of experiments

## Participation

All attendees should bring a laptop computer with an internet connection. All examples run in Google Colab, which requires a Google account. (For example, a personal Gmail account works fine.) Participants should also bring pencil and paper or an tablet to take notes. All instruction will be in English.
