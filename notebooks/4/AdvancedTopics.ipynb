    "### Sample Average Approximation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample average approximation (SAA) method is an approach for solving stochastic optimization problems by Monte Carlo simulation. It approximates the expected objective function of the stochastic problem by a sample average estimate derived from a random sample. The resulting sample average approximation problem is then solved by deterministic optimization techniques. \n",

    "### Sparse Grids (Worst Case)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of Monte carlo sampling, sparse grids can be used to obtain efficient characterizations of the integrals in stochastic programs. Many computational problems are solved on full grids. While this is feasible if the dimentionality $d$ of the problem is low, 2 or 3, full grids become very expensive when facing a higher dimentional problem $d>4$. This is due to the curse of dimensionality, which states that the complexity of full grids grows exponentially with $d$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sparse grids defeat the curse of dimentionality and allow the solution of the problems with much smaller effort. It is constructed by extending one-dimensional quadrature rules to higher dimensions. Gaussian quadrature rule is one of these rules to approximate the definite integral of a function. It is usually a weighted sum of function values at specified points within the domain of integration, stated as: \n",
