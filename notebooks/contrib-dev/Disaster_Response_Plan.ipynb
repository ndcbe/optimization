        "**Supplies Distributed**: The heatmap reveals a highly dynamic allocation of supplies across regions and time intervals. Certain regions and times received significantly higher distributions (indicated by bright yellow areas), which align with periods of elevated need or prioritization. This suggests that critical demands were met in these instances. However, some regions consistently received lower supplies, which highlights areas with reduced urgency or lower demand levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Supplies in Inventory**: The inventory heatmap shows that supplies in stock decrease sharply in regions and times of high distribution activity. On the other hand, regions with less immediate demand or lower prioritization maintain higher inventory levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Supplies Needed**: The supplies needed heatmap confirms the variability of demand across regions and time intervals. The bright areas (indicating higher needs) coincide with regions and times that received higher supplies in the distribution heatmap. This alignment suggests the system's responsiveness to actual demand. However, the scattered bright areas also highlight that demand is not uniform.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Final Need**: The heatmap of final unmet need reveals areas where the model succeeded in meeting demand (dark regions) versus areas with residual unmet need (lighter regions). In most cases, unmet needs are minimal, indicating efficient resource allocation. However, regions with persistent lighter areas highlight potential gaps in distribution, which could be due to constraints like supply limits or prioritization criteria."

        "To validate the model, this sensitivity analysis was conducted through utilizing Monte Carlo simulations. The result reveals the variability in the average supplies distributed across regions and time intervals under uncertain input parameters such as supply needs, danger levels, positional priorities, and initial inventories. The histogram of results highlights a distribution centered near zero. This indicates that, on average, the optimization model balances supply and demand effectively. However, the spread of the results reflects the influence of random fluctuations in the parameters, suggesting that certain scenarios may lead to significant deviations in supplies allocated to regions. This variability underscores the significance of robust planning in disaster response scenarios, where uncertainties in demand, resource availability, and prioritization can significantly impact the overall system performance."
