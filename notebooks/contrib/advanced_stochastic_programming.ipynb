    "The classic farmer problem is an good example in applied mathematics and numerical analysis, showcasing the interplay between optimization, resource management, and decision making under constraints. At its core, the problem involves determining how to allocate limited resources to maximize outcomes like crop yield or profit, while meeting various constraints imposed by environmental, economic, and operational factors. These constraints often reflect real world complexities, such as limited water supply, variable soil conditions, or fluctuating market demands.\n",

In practice, agricultural systems are subject to inherent uncertainties driven by dynamic and often uncontrollable factors.

These unpredictable elements create significant challenges, as farmers must navigate decision-making in environments characterized by incomplete or stochastic information.\n",

    " Sparse grids address the limitations of full grids by significantly reducing the number of points while maintaining comparable accuracy. The key idea is to focus on the most \"informative\" points in the integration domain, based on the hierarchical structure of the quadrature. Sparse grids achieve this by combining lower-dimensional full grids in a systematic way, effectively excluding redundant points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of sparse grids lies in the Smolyak algorithm, which constructs a sparse grid approximation for a d-dimensional integral as:\n",
    "$$ \\int_{[a,b]^d} f(x)dx ≈ \\sum_{|i|<m} c_i \\prod^d_{k=1} \\int^{b_k}_{a_k} f(x_k)dx_k $$\n",
    "where $c_i$  are coefficients determined by the hierarchical structure. By selectively including quadrature points based on their contribution to the approximation accuracy, sparse grids avoid the exponential growth in points observed with full grids.One of the primary advantages of sparse grids is their efficiency in handling high-dimensional integrals.  However, sparse grids may exhibit slightly higher errors for functions with highly localized or non-smooth behavior due to the reduced number of points."

    "Unlike the classical deterministic farmer problem, where crop yields are assumed to be known with certainty and we have perfect infomation, real-world scenarios often involve significant uncertainty. In this model, we account for this uncertainty by assuming that the yields of crops (WHEAT, CORN, and BEETS) follow a normal distribution characterized by a mean and standard deviation. By incorporating stochastic yields, we can create a more robust and realistic decision-making framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "To solve this problem, we employ a Full Grid Method using Gaussian quadrature to approximate the random variables. Gaussian quadrature allows us to efficiently represent the uncertainty in yields by selecting representative points (quadrature points) and associated weights, which capture the variability and likelihood of different yield outcomes. These points are combined to create scenarios that represent all possible combinations of crop yields, and scenario weights are calculated to reflect their probabilities.\n",

    "This approach ensures that the model captures the complexity and uncertainty of agricultural planning while leveraging stochastic programming techniques to optimize planting decisions, purchasing strategies, and sales, given the variability in crop yields."

    "The choice to model crop yields with a normal distribution is grounded in practical and theoretical considerations. Crop yields are influenced by a multitude of factors, such as weather, soil quality, and pest outbreaks. Using a normal distribution to represent these uncertainties provides several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Central Limit Theorem (CLT): While the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) suggests that the sum of many independent random variables tends to approximate a normal distribution, real-world factors influencing crop yield—such as weather patterns and soil conditions—are often interdependent. Despite this, the normal distribution can still serve as a reasonable approximation for yield due to the aggregate effect of numerous contributing variables.\n",

    "2.   Simplicity and Analytical Convenience:\n",
    "The normal distribution is well understood and widely used in stochastic modeling\n",

    "3. Tools like Gaussian quadrature can efficiently approximate expected values under normality, as was applied here using Hermite polynomials to generate points and weights.\n",

    "Contrary to the assumption made in [4.1. Stochastic Programming](https://ndcbe.github.io/optimization/notebooks/4/SP.html), we may also assume that yields for the different crops are **independent**. In that case, we may as well consider a **continuous random vector** for the yields. Again, the decisions on land allocation are first-stage decisions because they are taken befor knowledge of the yields. Second-stage formulation can again be described as $E_{\\xi}Q(x,\\xi)$, where $Q(x,\\xi)$ is the value of the second stage for a given realization of the random vector. The optimization problem becomes:  \n",

    "Sample Average Approximation (SAA) is a statistical method commonly used in stochastic programming and optimization to solve problems with uncertainty. The idea is to replace the expected values in a stochastic objective funtion ($E_{\\xi} Q(x,\\xi)$, in our case) with sample averages, using a finite set of random samples (scenarios). This converts the original stochastic problem into a deterministic one, which is often easier to solve. Here is a basic breakdown of the steps involved:\n",
    "1.   **Sample Generation**: A finite number of random samples (or scenarios) are drawn from the probability distribution representing the uncertainty in the problem. These samples capture possible realizations of the uncertain parameters.\n",
    "2.   **Objective Approximation**: The expected objective function in the original stochastic problem is approximated by the sample average of the objective over these scenarios.\n",
    "3.   **Deterministic Problem Formation**: With the sample average objective function in place, the problem becomes deterministic and can be solved using standard optimization techniques.\n",

    "* Formulate and solve optimization problems using real-world examples that incorporate uncertainty and stochasticity\n",
    "* Develop proficiency in Python and Pyomo for modeling and solving complex optimization problems\n",
    "* Understand and implement full-grid and half-grid discretization in stochastic optimization frameworks, including their respective advantages and applications.\n",
    "* Gain a deeper understanding of two-stage stochastic optimization, focusing on its application to agricultural systems under uncertainty\n",
    "* Interpret and analyze optimization results, drawing meaningful conclusions about resource allocation and decision-making in uncertain environments\n",

    "A major takeaway from this work is the recognition that alternative numerical methods, such as the half-grid approach, can effectively address the \"curse of dimensionality\" associated with full-grid methods. By accounting for the reality that perfect information is rarely available, we demonstrated how modeling uncertainty using Gaussian distributions leads to more realistic scenarios. Finally, this project highlighted the significance of two-stage stochastic optimization in tackling real-world problems, emphasizing its role in enabling robust and informed decision-making under uncertainty."
